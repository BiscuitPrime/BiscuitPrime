## About me 🍪

Hello, my name is Henri NOMICO, I am a french engineering student at <a href="https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/">**Télécom Sudparis**</a> 💻 ! I am currently learning many programming languages such as Bash, C, C#, Python, Java, PHP and HTML, as well as telecomunication and maths. I yearn to be a game developer in the future !

## My hobbies 🍰

 🎮 - Creating games that are fun to play is what I thrive for.
 
 🧊 - I am the president of Télécom Sudparis' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT-08PN1bcBDCU1GrhAOTGw">**The RIG**</a> (3D modelisation club), and quite enjoy making 3D art and assets.

A 2-player plateformer game developed as part of the <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/">**Global GameJam 2022**</a> where you play either as an enthusiastic attractive Axolotl or a shy repulsive Gecko, following the theme of **Duality**.

I was the **project manager** and **lead developper** during this 48h jam. You can play our game <a href="https://mathieu-coutant.itch.io/geckolot">**here**</a>
